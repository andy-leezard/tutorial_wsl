**WELCOME, WE DON'T HAVE TIME, LET'S GET TO THE POINT.**

# REQUIREMENTS

1. **Windows 10 Pro** **Version 2004** <sup>(May 2020 update)</sup> **or higher**

- Install available Windows updates if you have a lesser version.
- In this tutorial, I used the version **_22H2_**.
- If you really need to use an outdated version of Windows, use the [legacy method](/wsl/legacy1909/Readme.Md). However that will result in installing WSL1 kernel by default. You'll need to configure that separately.

# STEPS (RENEWED FOR WSL2)

1. Run this command as admin: **`wsl --list --online`**

- Choose one from the list of available distros. I'll go with **Debian**.

2. Your system needs to reboot, let it.

- This will litterally take few minutes. You have time to do some neck and shoulder stretches. Maybe some push-ups while you're at it. Health is important ðŸ’ª.

3. Update the WSL Kernel by running this command as admin on the regular Windows terminal: **`wsl --update`** or **`wsl.exe --update`**

4. Now on the Linux terminal, run this command to check the installed Linux version: **`cat /etc/issue`**

- There are also other ways to check it up depending on the distro you're using, but this is one simple way to go on Debian.

5. Get to know **_BASH_** by taking a look at **_.bashrc_**.

- Tip for beginners: whenever you start up a new Linux terminal session, it runs a startup script that you can configure in the **_.bashrc_** file. Bash is a programming language used to run codes from the terminal.
- To get to know Bash, create an **environment variable** called "ps1" (Prompt String <sub>value</sub>) in the **_.bashrc_** file.
- Currently you might see something like **`:mnt/c/Users/UserName$`**.
  You can change the way it looks by modifying the **_.bashrc_** file located in the Home directory.
- If you're a mega legendary developper expert in **_Vim_**, you would know how to do it: **`vi ~/.bashrc`**
- If you're a VS Code fan like me, as we always do: **`code ~/.bashrc`**

- Notice that the Prompt String has changed according to the **_.bashrc_** file.

6. Update APT by running these commands:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

- Tip for beginners: APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) is a command-line tool used to manage softwares.

7. Install **_curl_**: **`sudo apt install curl`**

- Test if it's correctly installed and operational: **`curl help`**

8. Install **_git_**: **`sudo apt install git`**

- Test if it's correctly installed and operational: **`git --version`**

- Config Git

```
$ git config --global user.name "YOUR USERNAME"
$ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

- NOTE: `git config --global core.autocrlf input` will prevent _carriage-return_ flags (**_\r_**) confusing git state when worked both on Windows and Linux.
- Likewise, on Windows System, the `input` part should be `true` when globally configuring git.

9. Install **_clang_**: **`sudo apt install clang`**

- Test if it's correctly installed and operational: **`clang --version`**

9. Using **_zsh_**.

- Is **_zsh_** already installed on your system? Ask it by running this command: **`zsh --version`**

- If not, install **_zsh_** by running this command: **`sudo apt install zsh`**

- Test if it's correctly installed and operational by running this command: **`zsh --version`**

- (RECOMMENDED) While you're at it, install [**_OH MY ZSH_**](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), the powerful interactive framework that helps you with **_zsh_** configuration. Use the curl request as instructed on the Github page.

- Change your default shell to **_zsh_** if you haven't already with **_OH MY ZSH_**: **`chsh -s $(which zsh)`**

- (OPTIONAL) Get to know .zshrc config by changing theme. Just make it random for fun. If you find an interesting theme, you can change it to that later.

9. Hook things up with VS Code. Get this extension.

- Open VS Code in the WSL.

- Boom, now you're building in Linux.

- My current theme is `fletcherm`

# MORE THEMES

- `Agnoster`

To use this theme, it is necessary to install some fonts before.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts
cd fonts
./install.sh from terminal / command line
```
