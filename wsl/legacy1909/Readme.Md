- If you want other distros, you can: **`wsl --list --online`**
- Please keep in mind that in this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu. Some commands may not work in other distros.

4. The magic word is **_wsl_**. This will take you to the Linux world on your Windows machine.

- (OPTIONAL) Run command: **`_lsb_release -a`** to check your Ubuntu version.
- (OPTIONAL) Run command: **`_htop_`** to monitor your machine.

5. Update APT by running these commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
- Tip for beginners: APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) is a command-line tool used to manage softwares.

- Oh look! this train is right on time unlike most real ones.


6. OK IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS. Open up the real terminal tab to enter Ubuntu.

- First thing you should know, is that whenever you start up a new Linux terminal session, it runs a startup script that you can configure in the **_.bashrc_** file. Bash is a programming language used to run codes from the terminal.
- To get to know Bash, create an **environment variable** called "ps1" (Prompt String <sub>value</sub>) in the **_.bashrc_** file.
- Currently you might see something like, **`:mnt/c/Users/UserName$`**. (full working directory, system name, username)
  You can change the way it looks by modifying the **_.bashrc_** file located in the Home directory.
- If you're a mega legendary developper expert in **_Vim_**, you would know how to do it: **`vi ~/.bashrc`**
- If you're a VS Code fan like me, as we always do: **`code ~/.bashrc`**

- Do you see the Prompt String has changed according to the **_.bashrc_** file?

7. Using **_zsh_**.

- Is **_zsh_** already installed on your system? Ask it by running this command: **`zsh --version`**
- If not, it will kindly guide you to install it.
- Change your default shell to **_zsh_** running this command : **`chsh -s $(which zsh)`**

- (RECOMMENDED) While you're at it, install [**_OH MY ZSH_**](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), the powerful interactive framework that helps you with **_zsh_** configuration. Use the curl request.

8. Hook things up with VS Code. Get this extension.

- Open VS Code in the WSL. Ignore the message that you're not using WSL2 if you see one, you can upgrade your WSL kernel later.
